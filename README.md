Non-LTE Excitation Solver for Planetary Systems

Currently solving the statistical equilibrium equations to do non-LTE excitation of the CO molecule, including fluorescence. 

Awaiting more organised documentation, please see the simple NLTE exercise tutorial for classic usage, and refer to the detailed documentation within the main code elrovibpopcalc_CO.py under /utils.
